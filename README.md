# Invigoration Pattern a.k.a The Invigorator's Trammel

_If Tetris was applied to Software Engineering, it would be about the Invigoration Model._

A series of pre-existing shapes are subjected to being dynamically arranged by a pack-and-place management tool which allows individual shapes to be placed subject to the arrangement of those shapes that have preceded them; paralellism is achieved by the same game being played in parallel, with fanning in being represented by the accumulated scores of each of the games.

### INVIGORATION

- 'Invigoration' is the "the activity of giving vitality and vigour to something", which in the Software Engineering sense, is achieved by an Actor causing an Action to be undertaken upon an Object.
  
### INVIGORATION PATTERN / INVIGORATOR'S TRAMMEL

- An 'Invigoration Pattern' also known as an 'Invigorator's Trammel', is a statement that defines the relationship of an Object with it's Actor, within the constraints of the Trammel.
  
### INVIGORATOR

- An 'Invigorator' is "an agent that gives or restores life or vigor", which in the Software Engineering sense, is the mechanism that exposes the channel of the invigoration trammel (it's freedoms), as well as it's constraints.
  
### TRAMMEL

- A 'Trammel' (noun) is defined as "restrictions or impediments to freedom of action.", with 'freedom within the channel of the trammel' implied to exist by the very nature of the constraints.
- A pictorial grasp of how a trammel can dynamically convert singular lines of actions into a range of dynamic opportunities, can be obtained by looking at videos on YouTube about [The Trammel of Archimedes](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=archimedes+Trammel).
