INVIGORATION PATTERN

_If Tetris was applied to Software Engineering, it would be about the Invigoration Model._

A series of pre-existing shapes are subjected to being dynamically arranged by a pack-and-place management tool which allows individual shapes to be placed subject to the arrangement of those shapes that have preceded them; paralellism is achieved by the same game being played in parallel, with fanning in being represented by the accumulated scores of each of the games.
